### I am an experience and architectural designer who thrives when given the opportunity to problem-solve, creating empathetic solutions through a process-driven strategy.
### I have over 4 years of experience working in interdisciplinary design teams, and my background in architecture has instilled a strong desire to unite form and function in my designs. Furthermore, I have experience with HTML, CSS, JS, strong skills in 3D modelling (Blender) and I will bring my eye for detail to my projects.
### I had been living in China for 6 years and graduated from the university with a dual bachelor's degree in architecture (RIBA part I).
